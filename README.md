# DESCRIPTION:
The Weather Dashboard is a web application built with React that allows users to retrieve real-time weather information for any city worldwide. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short description of the weather. The application is designed with a clean and responsive interface, making it accessible and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
1. React.js: Core library for building the interactive user interface.
React's state management (useState) to handle form inputs and display weather data dynamically.
2. Axios: A popular HTTP client library used to make API requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
3. OpenWeatherMap API: Source for real-time weather data, providing details like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
4. Bootstrap: CSS framework used for basic styling and layout to ensure consistency and responsiveness.

## How It Works:
1. Input Field: Users can type a city name into the input field and submit their request.
2. API Integration: The application sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the entered city name.
3. Data Display: If the city is found, the weather data is displayed on a card with details such as:
Temperature (Â°C)
Weather description (e.g., clear sky, rain)
Humidity
Wind speed
4. Error Handling: If the city name is invalid, the user receives an error message prompting them to try again.
